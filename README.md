Mips16bit
==================

Mips16bit is a RISC pipelined cpu (in vhdl) made as part of a university course 
assignment in Computer Architecture.
It implements the commands and, or, add, sub, mult, geq, not, mfpc, sll, srl. 
I didn't include the data/instruction memory necessary for the project to compile
since it was provided in the instructions.
